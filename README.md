To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux: 

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```


Open Command Prompt (CMD), make sure the CMD is set to the folder where your project is, and execute:
```
py -3 -m venv venv
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
venv\Scripts\activate.bat 
```
